The Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) developed a model that allows for Census tract estimation using the National Household Travel Survey (NHTS) data along with American Community Survey (ACS) data from the Census Bureau. The model divides the NHTS data into six geographic areas, classifies these areas as urban/suburban/rural, and then estimates average weekday household: person miles traveled, person trips, vehicle miles traveled, and vehicle trips for each geographic area. The BTS model then transfers the estimates to individual Census tracts using the household and demographic data from the ACS for each Census tract.

The resulting Census tract estimates provide beneficial indicators to local governments and other customers who may not have the budget and/or time for conducting their own local survey. Additionally, the use of a standard set of questions across all geographies in the NHTS enables comparison across geographies that otherwise would be captured in dcensus tracts with zero population, or census tracts with very unusual demographic or travel characteristics.",yes,

Original dataset descriptions:
Earthquake Strong Motion Data (1933–1994)

The Earthquake Strong Motion Data catalog is the inventory of Accelerograph Record descriptions for the NCEI Earthquake Strong Motion Database. The data, which date from 1933 to 1994, are representative of a broad range of structural and geologic recording environments. Various industrial, academic, and governmental sources located around the world contributed records to the archive.

Earthquake CD Collections

NCEI provides online access to the Earthquake Strong Motion and Seismicity Catalog databases. These collections were previously available as CD-ROMs.
Earthquake Strong Motion (CD Rom Archives)
The Strong Motion Database collection contains over 15,000 digitized and processed accelerograph records. It was previously available as a physical collection of three CD-ROMs.

The data represent a broad range of structural and geologic recording environments. Three types of processed records are included on the CDs:

Sample material is available directly from each repository. Before proposing research on any sample, please contact the repository’s curator for sample condition and availability.

Each repository submits data gleaned from physical samples to the IMLGS database, which is maintained by NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI). All sample data include basic collection and storage information, whereas some samples, at the discretion of the curator, may also include lithology, texture, age, mineralogy, weathering, metamorphism, glass remarks, color, physiographic province, principal investigator, and/or descriptive information.

This deposit also includes the html of the original dataset landing page for reference. See this NOAA NCEI record for more metadata and current access options.

Original dataset description:
The U.S. Earthquake Intensity Database (1638–1985) is a collection of damage and felt reports for more than 23,000 U.S. earthquakes. The database contains information regarding epicentral coordinates, magnitudes, focal depths, names, and coordinates of reporting cities/ localities, reported intensities, and the distances to the epicenter. Earthquakes listed in the file date from 1638 to 1985. The majority of the felt reports are in the U.S. States and Territories (155,301). Other reporting countries include: Antigua and Barbuda (2), Canada (1,364), Mexico (54), Panama (285), and the Philippines (9).

Database Description:
The Earthquake Intensity File contains more than 157,000 reports on over 20,000 earthquakes that affected the United States from 1638 through 1985. The principal data included for each earthquake are the names and geographic coordinates of the cities/localities that reported effects from earthquakes, (hereafter called ""reporting cities"") and the intensities assigned to those effects. Each intensity has been assigned using the Modified Mercalli Intensity Scale of 1931 (Wood and Neumann, 1931). Other information given for each earthquake includes: distance of each reporting city from the epicenter of the earthquake; number of hours to subtract from Universal Time (UT) to obtain origin time in local standard time; reference (authority) codes for reporting cities and intensity values, and state codes. In addition, the date, origin time, epicenter, magnitude, and depth (where available) are given for all earthquakes.

Although the Earthquake Intensity File represents an important contribution to seismology research, it has several limitations that should be mentioned:

About 25 percent of the 2,500 earthquakes reported from 1638-1928 and 10 percent of the 18,500 events from 1928-1980 do not have instrumental epicenters; this omission is mainly due to the fact that seismological instruments were not developed until the late 1800s, and further that the instruments were not widely distributed for many years later.
Several of the reporting cities listed in the file have not been assigned geographic coordinates.
The file contains data primarily for those earthquakes that have epicenters in the United States, nearby U.S. territories, and areas of Canada and Mexico that border the United States. Data for a few events in the Philippines (from the late 1930s through 1941) is also included.",yes,https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/metadata/landing-page/bin/iso?id=gov.noaa.ngdc.mgg.hazards%3AG01142

This deposit also includes html and a webarchive of the original dataset landing page at https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/natural-hazards/tsunamis-earthquakes-volcanoes/earthquakes/cd-collection, which now points to an updated metadata and data access page.

Original dataset description:
This compilation of seismicity catalogs from was previously as a two-volume CD-ROM collection. It contains data on over four million earthquakes dating from 2100 B.C. to 1995 A.D. The data include information on epicentral time of origin, location, magnitudes, depth and other earthquake-related parameters.

The collection includes three types of catalogs:
Local (containing data from single stations or local networks
Regional (containing data from regional networks, such as CALNET in central California
Teleseismic (containing data from around the world).
Records are from industrial, academic, governmental, and private sources from around the world. The CDs also contain auxiliary data bases (such as world stress, tsunami, volcanic, fault parameters, etc.) which aid in earthquake investigations.

Volume 1 contains events for United States, Central America, Canada, the Caribbean, Decade of North American Geology Project (DNAG), Mexico, and other Supplemental Algorithms and Catalogs.

Data Access
