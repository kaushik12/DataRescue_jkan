# Data Rescue Project protal
This is a front-end interfact for the [Data Rescue Project Tracker](https://baserow.datarescueproject.org/public/grid/Nt_M6errAkVRIc3NZmdM8wcl74n9tFKaDLrr831kIn4) to enable users to search, filter, and access information about rescued data with greater ease. 

The protal was built using [JKAN](jkan.io), a lightweight, backend-free open data portal, powered by Jekyll developed by Tim Wisniewski.
