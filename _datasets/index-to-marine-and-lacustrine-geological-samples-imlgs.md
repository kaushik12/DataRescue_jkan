    notes: This copy of the Index to Marine and Lacustrine Geological Samples (IMLGS) was created on April 22, 2025 before its decommission on May 5, 2025. In addition to the csv file of the sample data, this deposit includes the html of the original NCEI page (https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/index-marine-lacustrine-samples,) a webarchive of metadata provided by NCEI from https://data.noaa.gov//metaview/page?xml=NOAA/NESDIS/NGDC/MGG/Geology/iso/xml/G00028.xml&view=getDataView&header=none, and an ML Commons Croissant metadata file that was generated for the csv file. The keywords below come from the NCEI dataset overview page. The Croissant file contains basic information about the columns. See the NCEI overview for more context on this dataset.Original Description from dataset landing page (https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/index-marine-lacustrine-samples,)The Index to Marine and Lacustrine Geological Samples (IMLGS) is a community designed and maintained resource that enables scientists to discover and access geological material from seabed and lakebed cores, grabs, and dredges archived at participating institutions from around the world. Sample material is available directly from each repository. Before proposing research on any sample, please contact the repository’s curator for sample condition and availability.Each repository submits data gleaned from physical samples to the IMLGS database, which is maintained by NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI). All sample data include basic collection and storage information, whereas some samples, at the discretion of the curator, may also include lithology, texture, age, mineralogy, weathering, metamorphism, glass remarks, color, physiographic province, principal investigator, and/or descriptive information. The public can access the IMLGS database by using NOAA NCEI’s data access resources.
