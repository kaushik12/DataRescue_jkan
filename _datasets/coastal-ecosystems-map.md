    notes: This copy of the underlying data for the Coastal Ecosystems Map was downloaded on April 17, 2025 before the map viewer was decommissioned on May 5, 2025. The directory structure follows the order that the original map layers were in (Physical Data, Biotic Data, Living Marine Resources, Socioeconomic Conditions, Environmental Quality, Jurisdictions). You can view what the original map viewer looked like here https://web.archive.org/web/20250423220047/https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/maps/coastal-ecosystems/viewer.htm but note that the original functionality might not work through the Wayback Machine. The original url (https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/maps/coastal-ecosystems/viewer.htm) now points to a resource called the Gulf Data Atlas, where the data can be viewed and filtered in a map viewer.Each subdirectory contains more subdirectories for various layers. In those, there are directories for metadata and data, along with csvs of the data and metadata links that were used to populate these directories. The links were copied from the original viewer for each layer. Output logs (when present) are of the wget commands used to download data. Sometimes links would 404, and these would be documented in the output logs.
