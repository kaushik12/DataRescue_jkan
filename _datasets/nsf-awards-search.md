    notes: In January 2025, NSF converted the downloadable format for all awards from XML to JSON.In April 2024, NSF extended Program Element Codes (PECs) from four to six digits. Existing four-digit codes were converted to six-digits by adding a '00'. For example, PEC 4634 and 463400 are the same. Any updates to older awards use the new six-digit codes.The ""Historical Awards"" file contains all awards made prior to 1976. Please note that some data, such as text abstracts, are not available for these older awards.
