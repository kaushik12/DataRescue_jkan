See the new page for more metadata and background information.Original dataset descriptionGeothermal energy is heat that is expelled from Earth's interior via hot springs, wells, hot dry rock, and molten rock. George W. Berry, Paul J. Grimm, and Joy A. Ikelman compiled the NOAA geothermal energy database (NOAA KGRD No. 12.) with support from the U.S. National Science Foundation (Grant EAR-8716958).Data AccessThe Thermal Springs List for the United States contains data from 1661 hot springs in the continental U.S., Hawaii, and Alaska.
