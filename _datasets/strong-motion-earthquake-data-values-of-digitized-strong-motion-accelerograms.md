    notes: This copy of the Strong Motion Earthquake Data Values of Digitized Strong-Motion Accelerograms was created on April 24, 2025 before its decommission on May 5, 2025. It contains all the files in the same hierarchy as originally accessible at https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/hazard/data/cdroms. Each of the three volumes was downloaded with wget and are available in the directories volume1, volume2, volume3. This deposit also includes the NCEI-strong-motion.xlsx and Event Listing.txt that appeared on the original dataset landing page at https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/natural-hazards/tsunamis-earthquakes-volcanoes/earthquakes/strong-motion-database-1933-1994 and https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/natural-hazards/tsunamis-earthquakes-volcanoes/earthquakes/cd-collection. The original dataset landing pages are also provides as HTMLs. Please see those for more context and metadata. The keywords below are taken from the NCEI dataset overview at https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/metadata/landing-page/bin/iso?id=gov.noaa.ngdc.mgg.hazards%3AG01145, which also has more metadata.Original dataset descriptionsEarthquake Strong Motion Data (1933â€“1994)The Earthquake Strong Motion Data catalog is the inventory of Accelerograph Record descriptions for the NCEI Earthquake Strong Motion Database. The data, which date from 1933 to 1994, are representative of a broad range of structural and geologic recording environments. Various industrial, academic, and governmental sources located around the world contributed records to the archive.Earthquake CD CollectionsNCEI provides online access to the Earthquake Strong Motion and Seismicity Catalog databases. These collections were previously available as CD-ROMs.Earthquake Strong Motion (CD Rom Archives)The Strong Motion Database collection contains over 15,000 digitized and processed accelerograph records. It was previously available as a physical collection of three CD-ROMs.The data represent a broad range of structural and geologic recording environments. Three types of processed records are included on the CDsUncorrected (raw)Corrected (filtered)Response spectra (includes Fourier spectra)
