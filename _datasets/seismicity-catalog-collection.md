    notes: The Seismicity Catalog Collection is a compilation dataset on over four million earthquakes dating from 2150 BC to 1996 AD from NOAA's National Geophysical Data Center and U.S. Geological Survey's National Earthquake Information Center. The data include information on epicentral time of origin, location, magnitudes, depth and other earthquake-related parameters. This database is static and is no longer being updated.PANGAEA (www.pangaea.de) was asked by the responsible data group to archive the content of the following two volumeshttps://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/hazard/data/cdroms/Seismicity_v1https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/hazard/data/cdroms/Seismicity_v2Volume 1 contains events for the United States, Central America, Canada, the Caribbean, Decade of North American Geology Project (DNAG), Mexico, and other Supplemental Algorithms and Catalogs.Volume 2 contains events for Africa, Antarctica, Asia, Australia, Europe, Oceania, South America, and Global Catalogs.

    notes: This copy of the Seismicity Catalog Collection was created on May 2, 2025 before its decommission on May 5, 2025. The deposit follows the same directory structure from the access link on the original dataset landing page. The links were https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/hazard/data/cdroms/Seismicity_v1/ and https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/hazard/data/cdroms/Seismicity_v2/ for Volume 1 and Volume 2. This deposit also includes html and a webarchive of the original dataset landing page at https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/natural-hazards/tsunamis-earthquakes-volcanoes/earthquakes/cd-collection, which now points to an updated metadata and data access page.Original dataset descriptionThis compilation of seismicity catalogs from was previously as a two-volume CD-ROM collection. It contains data on over four million earthquakes dating from 2100 B.C. to 1995 A.D. The data include information on epicentral time of origin, location, magnitudes, depth and other earthquake-related parameters.The collection includes three types of catalogsLocal (containing data from single stations or local networksRegional (containing data from regional networks, such as CALNET in central CaliforniaTeleseismic (containing data from around the world).Records are from industrial, academic, governmental, and private sources from around the world. The CDs also contain auxiliary data bases (such as world stress, tsunami, volcanic, fault parameters, etc.) which aid in earthquake investigations.Volume 1 contains events for United States, Central America, Canada, the Caribbean, Decade of North American Geology Project (DNAG), Mexico, and other Supplemental Algorithms and Catalogs.Data AccessVolume 1 contains events for the United States, Central America, Canada, the Caribbean, Decade of North American Geology Project (DNAG), Mexico, and other Supplemental Algorithms and Catalogs.Volume 2 contains events for Africa, Antarctica, Asia, Australia, Europe, Oceania, South America, and Global Catalogs.Updates to the Seismicity CDs and additional seismicity data can be obtained fromNational Earthquake Information Center, USGS
