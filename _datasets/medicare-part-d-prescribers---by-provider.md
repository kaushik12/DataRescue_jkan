    notes: Uploaded all data files I could identify from this website, a PDF of the homepage, and all the Related Datasets (https://data.cms.gov/provider-summary-by-type-of-service/medicare-part-d-prescribers/medicare-part-d-prescribers-by-provider) except for "Monthly Prescription Drug Plan Formulary and Pharmacy Network Information." This file is too large to deposit to Data Lumos, even as a ZIP. It needs to be better compressed using a different compression algorithm
