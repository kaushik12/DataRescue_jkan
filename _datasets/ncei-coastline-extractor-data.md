    notes: This copy of the Coastline Extractor data was downloaded on April 22, 2025 before the Coastline Extractor map viewer (https://noaa.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=2be2d19544414752b3088b81ae3f70dd) was decommissioned on May 5, 2025. Two polygons were drawn that attempted to cover all available data for all the continents with some overlap for continuity. These are represented as zipfolder and zip folder-2 in the directory. The data were downloaded with the "coastline high resolution" option. See https://web.archive.org/web/20250502202536/https://noaa.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=2be2d19544414752b3088b81ae3f70dd for an example of what the map viewer looked like on May 2, 2025 before being removed. Note that download functionality might not work through the Wayback Machine archive version of the viewer.
